## tinaV1

### tina is a tiny concertina-like instrument (OSC)

Like a concertina, *tina* is a two-handed performance instrument.

*tina* sends OSC data to a **Pure Data** script, which converts it to MIDI data -> which is routed to the softsynth of your choice.

[*tina* has it's own documention](demo_love/demo_docs/tinaV1.md)...

  * *tina* is the most definitive demonstration of the **panel** element, and it's interactive capabilities
  * As noted, it uses **Pure Data** to convert the OSC data to a MIDI stream (and lessen the OSC network load)
